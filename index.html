            <p><strong>One Snowed-in Prison.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Hundreds of Criminals Trapped Inside.</strong></p>
            <p>Cold-Keep’s inmates are going missing at an alarming rate. The bodies are not adding up. And neither is the warden’s list of excuses.</p>
            <p>Desperate for answers, Drywell Police Department turns to Walter, an officer haunted by the murder of his son, on thin ice after a routine traffic stop turns sour. Now with a family, career, and reputation on the line, he trades in his badge for prison stripes, delving undercover into Cold-Keep for some long overdue answers.</p>
            <p>But once inside, his motives quickly change when he discovers that the penitentiary hosts not only his son’s killer, but an ancient evil with a taste for the very criminals trapped within.</p>
            <p>With a shiv in hand, a ticking clock, and nerves stretched thin, Walter must fight his very nature and team up with the men he has spent his entire life working against before he too becomes one of the missing men of Cold-Keep.</p>
